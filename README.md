# A True Seattleite

##An interactive player v. computer board game built with HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.


##Game Play

Can you overcome the Seattle freeze and escape pitfalls marking you as a transplant? Make it from the beginning to the end of the board before the computer, with some help and hindrance from Seattle newcomer milestones and mishaps.

You are green, and the Computer is blue. Click the Space Needle icon in the upper right corner to determine how many spaces you'll move. Every so often, you'll land on a square that will give you a bonus (sun) and move you further along in the game, or a penalty (cloud) that will knock you back. The first player to reach the end wins. Good luck, and may the realest Seattleite prevail!
